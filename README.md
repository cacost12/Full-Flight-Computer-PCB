<h1>Full Feature Flight Computer</h1>

<p><b>Current PCB Revision:</b> 1.0</p>
<p><b>PCB Part Number:</b> A0002</p>

<p>
The full feature flight computer supports the full range of amateur rocketry recovery and launch configurations 
such as dual-deploy parachute recovery, staging, IMU and barometric pressure sensor data logging, and redundant
parachute ejection. In addition to all the functionality of the base flight computer model, the full feature 
board includes two IMUs for low and high G data collection, and two auxiliary ignition ports for use with staging
ignition and/or redunant parachute ejection charges.
